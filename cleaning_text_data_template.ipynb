       " 'Screen-detected unilateral non-palpable breast cancer (NPBC) shows favorable prognosis, whereas bilateral breast cancer (BBC), especially synchronous BBC (SBBC) manifests worse survival than unilateral breast cancer (BC). It remains unclear whether screen-detected bilateral NPBC has compromised survival and requires intensified treatment or favorable prognosis and needs de-escalating therapy.\\nFrom 2003 to 2017, 1,075 consecutive NPBC patients were retrospectively reviewed. There were 988 patients with unilateral NPBC (UniNPBC), and 87 patients with ipsilateral NPBC\\u2009+\\u2009any contralateral BC [(N\\u2009+\\u2009AnyContra) PBC], including 32 patients with bilateral NPBC (BiNPBC) and 55 patients with ipsilateral NPBC\\u2009+\\u2009contralateral palpable cancer [(N\\u2009+\\u2009Contra) PBC]. Median follow-up time was 91 (48-227) months. Clinicopathological characteristics were compared between UniNPBC and BBC, whereas relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) among BBC subgroups. RFS and OS factors of BBC were identified.\\nCompared to UniNPBC, patients with screen-detected bilateral BC had more invasive (85.1%, 74.8%), ER negative (26.4%, 17.1%), PR negative (36.8%, 23.5%), triple-negative (21.6%, 8.5%) BC as well as less breast conserving surgery (17.2%, 32.4%), radiotherapy (13.8%, 32.0%) and endocrine therapy (71.3%, 83.9%). 10\\xa0year RFS and OS rates of (N\\u2009+\\u2009AnyContra) PBC (72.8%, 81.5%), (N\\u2009+\\u2009Contra) PBC (60.6%, 73.9%), and synchronous (N\\u2009+\\u2009Contra) PBC (58.1%, 70.1%) were significantly compromised compared to UniNPBC (91.0%, 97.2%). RFS factors of BBC included pN3 (p\\u2009=\\u20090.048), lymphovascular invasion (p\\u2009=\\u20090.008) and existence of contralateral palpable interval BC (p\\u2009=\\u20090.008), while the OS relevant factor was pN3 (p\\u2009=\\u20090.018).\\nScreen-detected bilateral NPBC including SynBiNPBC and MetaBiNPBC showed good prognosis as UniNPBC so that the therapy of BiNPBC could be de-escalated and optimized according to UniNPBC. Contrarily, screen-detected ipsilateral NPBC with contralateral palpable BC [(N\\u2009+\\u2009Contra) PBC] manifested unfavorable survival worse than UniNPBC and synchronous (N\\u2009+\\u2009Contra) PBC had the worst survival among all subgroups, implying that these were actually bilateral interval BC and required intensified treatment.')"

       "'Post-Mastectomy Tissue Expander Placement Followed by Radiation Therapy A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Staged Autologous Versus Implant-Based Unilateral Reconstruction.There is no preferred approach to breast reconstruction for patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) who require post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT). Staged implant and autologous reconstruction both have unique risks and benefits. No previous study has compared their cost-effectiveness with utility scores. A literature review determined the probabilities and outcomes for mastectomy and staged implant or autologous reconstruction. Utility scores were used to calculate the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with successful surgery and postoperative complications. Medicare billing codes were used to assess costs. A decision analysis tree was constructed with rollback and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) analyses. Sensitivity analyses were performed to validate results and account for uncertainty. Mastectomy with staged deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap reconstruction is costlier ($14,104.80 vs $3216.93), but more effective (QALYs, 29.96 vs 24.87). This resulted in an ICER of 2141.00, favoring autologous reconstruction. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that autologous reconstruction was more cost-effective if less than $257,444.13. Monte Carlo analysis showed a confidence of 99.99% that DIEP flap reconstruction is more cost-effective. For patients with LABC who require PMRT, staged autologous reconstruction is significantly more cost-effective than reconstruction with implants. Despite the decreased morbidity, staged implant reconstruction has greater rates of complication.'"
