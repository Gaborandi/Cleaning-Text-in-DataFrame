# Cleaning-Text-in-DataFrame
this Python code helps you to clean your text data to make it ready for any NLP task

working with un-clean text will risk the outcome as the model won't be able to tokenize unfamiliar words. 

Also, removing such unnecessary tokens would help in making the sentences more understandable 

i'm applying this code on a data that i've downloaded from pubmed (medical abstracts)
